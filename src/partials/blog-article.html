    The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want 
    a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    So what is the difference between gaming 
    headphones and gaming headsets?
  </p><br>
  <p>
  Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic
  Gaming headphones are regular headphones
   that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. 
   However, they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too. 
   Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval, 
   accurate sound stage and immersive sound 
  experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    However, most audiophile headphones 
    do not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment slots. 
    You will need to get an external
     mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, 
    famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic 
    DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while
     streaming his games.
  
  </p><br>
  <p>
    There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming 
    headphones setup for gaming.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Benefits of Gaming Headphones
  Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
  </p>
  <p>
    As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic itself, 
    you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic and headphones.
     There is potential for better overall audio and microphone quality.
